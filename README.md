To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repo:

### Running the Application

This project has two parts that need to run at the same time: the Next.js website and the Genkit AI services. You'll need to open two separate terminal windows or tabs to run them concurrently.

**In your first terminal:**
1. **Run the Next.js frontend:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the main application, which you can view at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

**In your second terminal:**
1. **Run the Genkit AI flows:**
   ```sh
   npm run genkit:watch
   ```
   This starts the Genkit development server, which provides the AI functionalities used in the app. Keep this terminal running alongside the first one.
